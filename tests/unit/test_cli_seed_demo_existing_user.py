"""
Test: seed_demo should handle the case where admin@example.com already exists.

Important:
- We do NOT commit/flush a duplicate user with the same email, because that
  will always trigger an IntegrityError before seed_demo logic runs.
- Instead, we run seed_demo once to create DemoStore + user.
- Then we simulate "moving" the user to another merchant (without deleting it).
- Finally, we rerun seed_demo and assert that the existing user is reassigned
  back to DemoStore instead of inserting a duplicate.
